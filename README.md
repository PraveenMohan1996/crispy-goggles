# **SQL Project: Database Design and Analysis**

## **📖 Description**
This project demonstrates my expertise in database design, SQL querying, and data analysis. It involves creating a normalized database schema, writing advanced SQL queries, and deriving meaningful insights. The project also includes detailed documentation with flowcharts, an ER diagram, and a presentation to showcase the entire workflow.

## **🔑 Features**
- **Database Normalization and Schema Design**: Includes an ER diagram and a fully normalized structure.
- **SQL Queries**: Demonstrates complex SQL scripts, including JOINs, subqueries, and aggregate functions.
- **Flowchart**: Visual representation of the project's workflow.
- **Data Insights**: Extracts and interprets data for practical scenarios.
- **Final Presentation**: Summarizes the project, including goals, methodologies, and results.
